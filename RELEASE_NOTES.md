🔱 Release v1.5: The "Custom Supreme" Update

Welcome to the most powerful version of Media Extractor Supreme yet. This release transitions the project into a fully customizable media suite, giving you total control over how you interact with web content.

🚀 What's New in v1.5?
⚙️ Supreme Settings Dashboard: We’ve added a dedicated Options page. You can now toggle the Floating Sniffer, Context Menu, and Auto-Naming features to fit your workflow.
🔄 Cloud-Sync Preferences: Using chrome.storage.sync, your extension settings now follow your browser profile across all your devices.
📂 Visual Gallery Preview: The Gallery tab now features a smart thumbnail grid that filters out tiny icons and tracking pixels, showing you only the high-res assets you actually want.
🏷️ Intelligent Auto-Naming: No more videoplayback.mp4. The extension now scrapes page metadata to give your downloads meaningful names automatically.
